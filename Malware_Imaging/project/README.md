# Project

In here you will find two directories

1. hex_imager
2. models

## hex_imager
---

```python
from Malware_Imaging.project import hex_imager
```

The namespace hex_imager contains all of the image processing solutions, for either creating images from the hex files, or any post processing soultions like Spectral Image processing. Will include filters applied to the images to later see if there is an improvemnet in our models based on filtering.

## models
--

The namespace models is where you can find the code that was used to produce any model. Under the directory ```saved_models``` you can find any model that was built and then saved for either testing or evaluation.
